        Welcome to the issue tracker for new "fresh-start" master branch of Pinax. For
        information about the motivation for the fresh-start branch see this
        <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/pinax-core-dev/msg/ce51f79236ea4331">post to pinax-core-dev</a>
        although note that that post refers to the branch as  "fresh-start" but we have now renamed that to "master".

        This site is <b>ONLY</b> for issues relating to the new master branch.
        For the previous issue tracker, covering the older version of Pinax (now on master-old branch),
        see <a href="http://code-old.pinaxproject.com/">http://code-old.pinaxproject.com/</a>

        We have done a one-time migration of user accounts so your previous
        credentials will work here. Accounts will not be synchronized moving forward, though, and, at some
        point, code-old will be taken down.
